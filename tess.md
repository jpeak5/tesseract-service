Establish a service, and a deep understanding of that service, providing tesseract OCR & HOCR over http(s).

## Research/ Lit  Review
1. setup docker / python container
2. research (hello world) and choose between tornado & flask (each running on the container in 1)
3. research python-tesseract libs (py-tesseract seems most popular)
4. expose py-tess lib to HTTP via tornado/flask
5. ensure methods for OCR,HOCR
6. research aws deployment
7. research scaling in deployment
